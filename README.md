Project Summary: 
The objective of the proposed research project is to enhance climate services by filling critical gap in relative humidity data for the National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia. The plan is to produce representative high quality gridded relative humidity data by merging better quality satellite and reanalysis RH data of the Awash River Basin from global open sources with quality control in-situ records. We plan to first evaluate the quality of global data products, then produce new datasets by merging the relatively better RH data with quality control in-situ records. We propose to move research into-use by applying and testing the new data product for early drought detection ability and for human and livestock comfortability indices.  We plan on aiding implementation through our existing multidiscipline expert networks (climate scientist, data expert, and expert for artificial intelligence) and partnership with National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia.
